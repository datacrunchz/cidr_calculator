Hello friends! I decided after my IST 201 class for Cisco Internetworking, I wanted to make sure that I had something for future classes for quick reference concerning subnetting IPv4 addresses into small networks.
  I included the CIDR values 0-32, since this is all we have covered, but I am sure there's more I will add into this.
Thanks for checking this out!
